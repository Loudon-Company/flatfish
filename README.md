# flatfish 
Bottom-feeding fun!

## Description 
flatfish is a lib to scrape HTML based on a CSV w/ CSS selectors and configurable attributes (eg, page titles).
The ultimate goal of flatfish is to prep and load the HTML into Drupal.

## NOTE
As flatfish scrapes the HTML over the wire it can be a bit slow (10 minutes for 500 pages)


## INSTRUCTIONS
1. create a csv of URLs w/ CSS selectors
2. configure your yaml w/ project specifics
3. run flatfish
